# EDGE DETECTION USING OPENMP
Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries or edges within an image. The Sobel operator is a popular edge detection method that uses convolution with a pair of 3x3 kernels to approximate the gradient of the image intensity.

# Steps in Edge Detection Using the Sobel Operator:
    1) Grayscale Conversion
    2) Apply Sobel Kernels
    3) Compute Gradient Magnitude
